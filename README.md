<h1> MIPSPY </h1>
<h2> A MIPS simulator / debugger built in python </h2>

MIPSPY aims to simplyfy the running, debugging, and creation of simple mips scripts using a lightweight terminal design, rather than a burdensome IDE like some other clients do.


*USE*

- MIPSPY takes files in the form of a command line argument. Format: `python main.py FILENAME [-d]` 

- MIPSY can run code and can be ran in an optional `debug` mode [attach a `-d` to the end of your command line argument] to allow for a step by step walkthrough of the program for debugging purposes
